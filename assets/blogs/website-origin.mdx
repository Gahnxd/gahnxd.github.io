# How This Website Came To Be
## How It Started
Last final before summer break: survived an 8AM exam, crawled to the library, and started brainstorming some summer project ideas cuz I'm finally free (from school). Looked over and see my friend coding up a silly looking ahh personal website using straight-up markdown. Like, bro was on a whole side quest with some markdown rendering stuff. Watching that, I refused to go through bro's struggle and gave myself a challenge: fully vibe code my own website.

## Windsurf Plan Mode
So, yeah, I ended up going with Windsurf for this. Was about to make Claude whip up some ESSENTIAL files for the website so I could get this site on GitHub Pages. But then I saw Windsurf dropped a "plan mode" update and instantly toggled it and let it cook. It spit out a whole `plan.md` file with a long ahh to-do list, so I immediately peaced out to watch Outdoor Boys on YouTube (rip). Meanwhile, Claude is generating my whole website like it’s running a marathon. Honestly, never seen an LLM grind this hard.

## Locking In
After Claude’s epic coding session, I decided to actually do something and activated prompt engineer mode. Few prompts later, my prompts are getting longer, instructions are getting more aggresive, and `plan.md` metamorphosed from cute lil 10 line todo-list to a 100+ line abomination. At some point, I realized I was spending more time waiting on Claude than actually typing anything myself.

## My Contributions?
Honestly? Not a lot. Added a couple of JSON files for my projects/blogs, fixed up my contact info, and wrote this blog post. That’s it. The rest? AI did it while I ate popcorn and watched this beautiful mess come together. Truly a moment of serenity and peak vibe coder experience.

## How It's Going
Everyone should just start letting LLMs do their thing. I used to be super skeptical about AI tools, just coping and pasting from ChatGPT like an unc. But this was my first time really going full vibe mode and letting AI take the wheel. It genuinely feels like crossing a line you can’t come back from. Maybe I sound dramatic, but if you’ve also gone full vibe mode, you probably get it. It’s like a weird new addiction; didn’t want to rely on it, but also didn’t want to miss out either.

Anyway, here I am. Certified vibe coder. If you made it this far through my rambling, congrats. You’re probably a vibe coder too, and just as guilty. But honestly, who cares? AI era is here, might as well squeeze every drop out of it.
